    <main>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>These are the functions we can use in a trasform's values:
            <ol>
              <li>Transform: scale()</li>
              <li>Transform: rotate()</li>
              <li>Transform: translate()</li>
              <li>Transform: skew()</li>
              <li>Transform: matrix()</li>
              <li>Transform: perpective()</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                  We use separate functions, in order, and as values, e.g. transform: scale(0.5) rotate(45deg) because
                  the order is the most important.
              </li>
              <li>
                We could have had separate properties like: transform-scale: 0.5;, or transform-rotate: 45deg
                so that they will not delete each other.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Often, we want to move the central pin or axis of the transform away from its default position.
              We can use transform-origin property to set that.
          </li>
          <li>It is preferable to use transform: translate() rather than position and its associated properties because
              in position you have to set position's values and left or right too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                  When an element is translated / transformed, the flow of the document does not change.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Transform is similar to position property.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                  The problem you run in when overriding a transform in a specific selector:
              <li>
                the one which you set in the parent will not work.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If we want to go 3D, we need to use transform: perspective() to set the view over the scene.</li>
          <li>By using transform-box property, we can control what the transform uses in its calculations in terms of the box model.</li>
        </ol>
